# AppleWatchDateTimePicker
A date and time picker setup for Apple Watch, since one doesn't exist. 

Uses numbers for everything because text doesn't fit too well, but you can try and make it. 
Displays the chosen date or time above the pickers so you know what you're getting. 
Uses actual dates to populate the pickers so you can't select February 31st, or something. Also accounts for leap years.
